            <summary type="approach">use data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young Women
                and Young Men to test their hypothesis that nonfamily living by young adults alters
                their attitudes, values, plans, and expectations, moving them away from their belief
                in traditional sex roles.</summary>
            <summary type="general">They find their hypothesis strongly supported in young females,
                while the effects were fewer in studies of young males. Increasing the time away
                from parents before marrying increased individualism, self-sufficiency, and changes
                in attitudes about families.</summary>
            <relevance type="value_stmt">In contrast, an earlier study by Williams cited below shows
                no significant gender differences in sex role attitudes as a result of nonfamily
                living.</relevance>
            <relevance type="application">This debate in the sociological literature is important
                for anyone seeking to historicize the “family values” debate of the 1980s and 90s in
                the U.S.</relevance>

            <summary type="interpretation">It's clearly anti-genetic engineering; its chapter titles
                give a good idea of the direction and flavor of the book, for example, "Eugenics,"
                "Eliminating 'Bad' Genes," "Bio-Futures," "Scientists and Corporation." Though the
                book is dated, the debates surrounding gene therapy at the time of the book’s
                publication are remarkably similar to today.</summary>
